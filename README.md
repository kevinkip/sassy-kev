# What was my motivation?
- It's 2023 and AI is everywhere. The last thing I want is to be late to the party. So I decided to get familiar with OpenAI's API in generating different things i.e. code, music, videos, etc. 

# Why did I build this project?
- I needed the practice. And there wasn't any other way for me to get better without building a project that involves AI. (Setting up the API settings, making sure the routes weren't throwing any errors...there were a lot of errors.) 

# What did I learn?
- Take your time when setting up the API's with your components. There are a few updates to OpenAI (ver.3 vs ver.4) that aren't big per se, but they needed some time to adjust the code towards. 

Also, I can see the potential business opportunity here in the future by developing an AI Saas project. 

Just haven't drafted the whole thing yet. But otherwise, this was fun and I'm looking forward to making more projects with OpenAI.
